      <div className="mt-4">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to our computer basics tutorial! In this section, we'll dive deep into the concept of the clipboard and the essential keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, Ctrl+X, and Ctrl+Z.

        <h2>What is a Clipboard?</h2>
        <p>The clipboard is a temporary storage area in your computer's memory. When you copy or cut something (like text, an image, or a file), it gets stored in the clipboard. You can then paste this item elsewhere. The clipboard holds the item until you copy or cut something else or restart your computer.</p>

        <h2>Using Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V</h2>
        <p>Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V are keyboard shortcuts that make copying and pasting much faster and more efficient:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ctrl+C:</strong> Press Ctrl and C together to copy the selected item to the clipboard.</li>
          <li><strong>Ctrl+V:</strong> Press Ctrl and V together to paste the item from the clipboard to the current location.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These shortcuts can be used in most applications, including word processors, web browsers, and file managers.</p>

        <h2>Cut and Paste with Ctrl+X</h2>
        <p>In addition to copying, you can also cut an item to move it from one place to another:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ctrl+X:</strong> Press Ctrl and X together to cut the selected item. This removes the item from its current location and stores it in the clipboard.</li>
          <li>Then, use <strong>Ctrl+V</strong> to paste the item in a new location.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div className="mt-4">
        <h2>Undo Mistakes with Ctrl+Z</h2>
        <p>If you make a mistake, like accidentally deleting text or pasting the wrong item, you can use the undo shortcut:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ctrl+Z:</strong> Press Ctrl and Z together to undo the last action. You can often press this multiple times to undo several actions.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div className="mt-4">
        <h2>Tips for Efficient Clipboard Usage</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Use <strong>Ctrl+Shift+V</strong> in some applications to paste text without formatting, which is useful for copying text from a website into a plain text document.</li>
          <li>Be mindful of what you have stored in your clipboard, especially when handling sensitive information, as it can be accessed by other applications.</li>
          <li>Consider using clipboard manager tools if you need to store multiple items in your clipboard for later use.</li>
        </ul>
